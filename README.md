# ðŸŽ‰ Events by Facebook

It was fun working on this project, here are some of the things I kept in mind while building this app. I also wanted to explain some of my decisions in this document.

#### CollectionView over TableView
When I started building this app, I initially wanted to stack conflicting events side-by-side. However later it occurred to me that there is no limit on how many such events can conflict with each other. If there are more than 2 such events, then the width will be too small to display enough information.
I am thinking of increasing the cell height for events which are longer, to provide more context for the user.

#### Conflicts Detecting Algorithm
I am sorting the events list before I try to find collisions. The sorting algorithm takes O(n log n). I decided to use â€˜.sorted{ }â€™ to sort them instead of writing my own sorting algorithm.
The event conflict finding algorithm runs on O(n). It works on a single pass because the list is already sorted.
Conflicting events are marked in red color.

#### Codable
I have used Codable to convert the JSON data into something my app can consume. I have added checks so that if the conversion fails, the app wonâ€™t crash and will show an error view.

#### Design
While trying to build this app, Iâ€™ve tried to remain faithful to the UI design of the Facebook app. Iâ€™ve tried to use colors which will make it feel like it is a part of the original app. I visited the Events page to come up with inspiration.

#### Colors
I have added the custom colors to the XCAssets to reuse them easily.

#### Loose Strings
I have taken out all the loose strings, colors and numbers and put them in a Constants.swift file for better organization.

#### Swift Lint
I used Swift Lint to keep track of errors. I have taken it off because I am not sure if you have it on your system and whether that might give some error.

#### Git
I have tracked the major changes with git.

#### Things I will add in version 2.0
- Unit tests. I wanted to generate couple of mock sons with valid and invalid data to test the conflict algorithm.
- Ability to show events which conflict side-by-side. I need to figure out a way to make sure that if 3 or more events are colliding, they shouldnâ€™t clump up together on the same row. It can work on an iPad.
- Display activity icons based on the event title. I have few activity icon sets but I need to be able to associate words with the icon. Eg. â€˜beer, pub, drinksâ€™ should point to the â€˜bar.pngâ€™ image. I found an existing project which returns an appropriate emoji for any search string.
- Dark mode.
- Ability to search for events.
- Make it easy to extend by downloading a JSON from the server.
- Possibly use animations to show cells colliding if there is a scheduling conflict. Iâ€™m not sure if this is a good idea.
